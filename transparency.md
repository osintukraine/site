# Costs / Transparency / Contribute

Crowdfunding costs  
In the last few months, all the costs have been covered by personal funds or friends/supporters donations.  
  
We don’t crowdfund publicly because there is no reason to divest funds that could Help Ukraine  
  
If you really want to contribute, Donate to  
[Verified Charities](https://standforukraine.com/)  
  
My Personal recommendation goes to ComeBackAlive and Prytula Foundation.

## Time

The Project started on the 24th of February 2022 and have been operating ever since at the rate of an estimation of 10h/day, every day for 7 month straight, until a burnout led me to take a pause.

Depending on the daily hours given to move the project forward, this is more than 1200h of work from February to September 2022, from a conservative estimation.

In 2023 I’m trying to adapt for a marathon and finding balance to make the project sustainable and finding volunteers to bring this project to its Version 2 while keeping the current iteration afloat and operational, the amount of work range from a few minutes every day to a few hours.

By sponsoring a membership Tier, you directly participate into securing the stability of the archive and if we can get enough sponsors, we can grow the number of Telegram channels we archive and the Video Storage capacity we have to archive Telegram videos.
