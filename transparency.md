# Costs / Transparency / Contribute

## Why Donations Are Needed

Since 2022, the project has been sustained thanks to my own funds and the help of a few close friends and supporters.  
That budget is now exhausted.  

To keep the archive alive, we urgently need contributions.  
The main costs are **servers** and the **storage of terabytes of historical data** that cannot be lost.  

I‚Äôve always tried to avoid fundraising because every euro could instead go directly to Ukraine. But this archive has become a long-term commitment, and without outside help, it cannot continue.  

If you prefer, please consider donating to  
[Verified Charities](https://standforukraine.com/)  

My personal recommendation goes to **ComeBackAlive** and **Prytula Foundation**.  

If you want to help keep this project alive, here are the real costs ‚¨áÔ∏è

## Total Costs
All included : 

Per year: **‚Ç¨3,598.08**  
Per month: **‚Ç¨299.84**  

## Servers
### Server ‚Äì ‚Ç¨143.23/month

**VPS 1**  
24 Core "AMD EPYC 7282 16-Core Processor"  
126.61 GB RAM  

‚û°Ô∏è This server is still **looking for a core sponsor**  

**VPS 2**  
10 Core "Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v4 @ 2.10GHz"  
67.42 GB RAM	

‚úÖ **donations to help are welcome**  

**Purpose : hosting, computation, scraping and automation workflows, project management tools.**  

## Telegram Video Storage
### Storage ‚Äì ‚Ç¨1632 / Year
#### 136 ‚Ç¨ per month (incl. 21% VAT)

We pay to keep past years‚Äô video archives online. This is critical: once deleted, this unique data cannot be recovered.  

- 20 TB ‚Äì 2022-202x - Video Storage Ukraine ‚Üí **40 ‚Ç¨/month (needs sponsor)**  
- 20 TB ‚Äì 2022-2024 - Archive Russian Video ‚Üí **40 ‚Ç¨/month (needs sponsor)**  
- 20 TB ‚Äì 2025-202x - Russian Data ‚Üí **40 ‚Ç¨/month ** (needs sponsor)**

Without continuous funding, old archives risk being lost.  

## CDN
Content Delivery Network: **20 ‚Ç¨/month**  
(incl. 21% VAT) 

## Costs Reduction

### How I Cut Costs by Replacing Inoreader with a Custom Python Solution
Previously, I relied on eight Inoreader accounts (each costing ‚Ç¨96 per year) to aggregate data from Telegram channels. Inoreader‚Äôs limitations‚Äîsuch as a 30-channel cap per account‚Äîmeant I needed multiple subscriptions to cover all the channels I wanted to archive. The total annual cost was ‚Ç¨768, not including the overhead of managing multiple accounts and dealing with their restrictions.

### The Problem:

High Cost: ‚Ç¨768/year for Inoreader subscriptions.
Scalability Issues: Limited to 30 Telegram channels per account.
Complex Workflow: Data had to be sent via webhooks to N8N for translation (using DeepL) and then pushed back to Telegram, adding unnecessary steps and potential points of failure.

### The Solution:
I developed a custom Python script that:

Directly fetches Telegram channel data (no more Inoreader dependency).
Translates content using DeepL within the same script.
Formats and archives the translated content back to Telegram, ready for use.

### Key Benefits:

Cost Savings: Eliminated ‚Ç¨768/year in Inoreader fees.
Scalability: No more 30-channel limits; I can add as many Telegram channels as needed.
Simplified Workflow: Direct integration between Telegram, DeepL, and archiving‚Äîno intermediate tools required.
Full Control: Custom code allows for easy adjustments and future improvements.

### Result:
By removing Inoreader from the workflow, I‚Äôve reduced costs, increased flexibility, and streamlined the entire process‚Äîall while maintaining the same functionality.

## Time

The Project started on **24 February 2022** and has been running ever since.  

- 2022: ~10h/day for 7 months straight, until burnout forced a pause (~1200h of unpaid work).  
- 2023: switched to a ‚Äúmarathon pace,‚Äù balancing daily work and recruiting volunteers for Version 2.  
- 2024‚Äì2025: maintaining the archive, fixing automation issues, verifying integrity, and doing general maintenance every week.  

Your support ensures that this work can continue without losing years of precious data.
