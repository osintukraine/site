# Costs / Transparency / Contribute

Crowdfunding costs  
In the last few months, all the costs have been covered by personal funds or friends/supporters donations.  
  
We donâ€™t crowdfund publicly because there is no reason to divest funds that could Help Ukraine  
  
If you really want to contribute, Donate to  
[Verified Charities](https://www.defendukraine.org/donate)  
  
My Personal recommendation goes to ComeBackAlive and Prytula Foundation.

## Time

The Project started on the 24th of February 2022 and have been operating ever since at the rate of an estimation of 10h/day, every day for 7 month straight, until a burnout led me to take a pause.

Depending on the daily hours given to move the project forward, this is more than 1200h of work from February to September 2022, from a conservative estimation.

In 2023 Iâ€™m trying to adapt for a marathon and finding balance to make the project sustainable and finding volunteers to bring this project to its Version 2 while keeping the current iteration afloat and operational, the amount of work range from a few minutes every day to a few hours.
