# Costs / Transparency / Contribute

## Why Donations Are Needed

Since 2022, the project has been sustained thanks to my own funds and the help of a few close friends and supporters.  
That budget is now exhausted.  

To keep the archive alive, we urgently need contributions.  
The main costs are **servers** and the **storage of terabytes of historical data** that cannot be lost.  

I‚Äôve always tried to avoid fundraising because every euro could instead go directly to Ukraine. But this archive has become a long-term commitment, and without outside help, it cannot continue.  

If you prefer, please consider donating to  
[Verified Charities](https://standforukraine.com/)  

My personal recommendation goes to **ComeBackAlive** and **Prytula Foundation**.  

If you want to help keep this project alive, here are the real costs ‚¨áÔ∏è  

> Pricing updated to 2025

## Time

The Project started on **24 February 2022** and has been running ever since.  

- 2022: ~10h/day for 7 months straight, until burnout forced a pause (~1200h of unpaid work).  
- 2023: switched to a ‚Äúmarathon pace,‚Äù balancing daily work and recruiting volunteers for Version 2.  
- 2024‚Äì2025: maintaining the archive, fixing automation issues, verifying integrity, and doing general maintenance every week.  

Your support ensures that this work can continue without losing years of precious data.
