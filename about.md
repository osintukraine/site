# Who ?

> My name is Ben, supporting Ukraine from Belgium, I’m a DevOps in the making but also have a quite diverse experience with all things digital, open source collaboration tools, self-hosting and information monitoring, automation;

## How
> On the 24th of February, I dropped everything I was doing to support Ukraine with information amplification, sourcing of good information sources, dashboards, after an initial deep dive into Telegram from mobile and manual translations, I wanted to find a solution to **ease the pain of following the invasion of Ukraine**, my first idea was to use Google Translate to ease translation process and [provide the resulting output on the open web](https://amplifyukraine.eu) without the need of a telegram account.   
> This quickly evolved to a state where I’m able to host the [translation content along with the original context.](https://ruprop.ukrainewararchive.eu/)
{.is-warning}


> This first iteration evolved into the current set of [tools displayed on the front-page](https://osintukraine.com/), basically pushing the translations to different Discords, Telegram and Mastodon/Web channels with the intent to facilitate access, searching and archiving for **different reasons** : 
{.is-success}

## Why
> 1.  **To eliminate the language barrier issue** as much as possible with the current state of machine translation, I still remember 2014 and how the invasion of Crimea & Donbass left Ukraine voiceless.
> 2.  Provide **a solution for** [**newsrooms,**](https://rss.osintukraine.com) **journalists, activists and basically everyone to have an easier access to this information** for certainly, one of the defining moment of our generation in Europe and the global impact the War on Ukraine unleashed.
> 3.  **Hunt for Russian Disinformation** narratives and war crimes with the intent to archive it outside big platforms
> 4.  Find **intelligence signal in the ongoing cyberwar leaks** and operations to disrupt Putin and the system he controls to wage war on Ukraine.
> 5.  **Pressure** European capitals to **not concede a pre-cooked defeat with Putin at the cost of Ukraine integrity**.
> 6.  **Pressure Western Governments** to actually deliver their **Help to Ukraine**
> 7.  **Boycott Amnesty International** until the organization retract the “report” and formally apologies to Ukraine.
> 8.  **Put the Media under pressure for not covering Ukraine**, putting constantly the aggressor propaganda instead of the impact of the war against Ukraine.
> 9.  **Pressure Western Governments** **and allies** to Officially designate **Russia as a Terrorist State.**
> 10.  **Weapons for Ukraine** because a genocidal war from a Terrorist State does not get stopped by wishful thinking for peace.
