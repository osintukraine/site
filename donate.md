## Support the OSINT Ukraine Archive
Since February 24, 2022, the OSINT Ukraine project has been preserving and sharing thousands of hours of open-source intelligence from the war in Ukraine. Our archive is a vital resource for researchers, journalists, and human rights organizations, ensuring that the truth remains accessible to all.

## Why Your Support Matters
Our archive is at risk. For over three years, we’ve maintained this project—first through personal funds and the help of a few close friends, and later with the support of donors like you. But now, our budget is exhausted.

## Main costs:

Servers & Data Storage: We’ve already filled three 20TB storage units and will need a fourth in the coming months.

- Annual Budget: €3,168 (down from €3,954.32, thanks to cost-cutting efforts)
- Monthly Need: €264

## What we’ve achieved together:

Over 1,200 hours of unpaid work in 2022, and ongoing maintenance ever since.
A transparent, publicly accessible archive of sources from across the conflict.
A resource used by journalists, researchers, and human rights organizations worldwide.

## How You Can Help
Every donation, no matter the size, makes a difference. Your support ensures that this work can continue without losing years of precious data.
