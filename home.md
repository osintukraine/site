# OSINTukraine - OSINT Tools For Ukraine    
> OSINT tools to archive, document and debunk the Russian War against Ukraine
> This project is a Telegram Archive, a News aggregator & publishing engine designed to support Ukraine and keep Ukraine information in the News cycle. 

> As of 2025 osintUkraine.com archive will be sunsetted, I cannot afford the telegram data aggregation cost, at least in the way it is setup now, we are looking for a Ukrainian interested person/organisation/ngo interested to get a copy of the Archive
{.is-warning}

> This project is going to be shutdown in early 2025
{.is-danger}



> As you can notice, this is the same data represented in different ways, it might feel a lot, but the goal here is to go around some limitations of the project and providing the ability to search/filter and better explore the overall collection.

> All Services running smooth ! 11-09-2024
{.is-success}


> Redeploying the video-only archive, 🇺🇦 is done, 🇷🇺 is done!
