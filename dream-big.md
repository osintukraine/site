# Just Ideas
> But, if we had unlimited funds/means/capacity to push the ideas behind OSINTukraine further, where could it go ? what could be possible?

## Data [research](/research)

- use Machine Learning on the **text** data to infer quality signal to noise information that could be useful to Ukraine
- use Computer Vision and AI models to scan all the **Video** data and look for potential geolocation position, videos that could be useful to infer actionable information, military equipment, troops movements, anything of importance in ennemy provided videos that could help identify targets for Ukraine
- a better and more accurate alert system allowing us to spot interesting piece of information in the overall archive (nearly 2 years of telegram posts and videos is a LOT of data (around 20TB now)

## Interface [Design](/archive)

- a Complete rework of the front-end for the telegram video & text archives
- Unified interface to search and consult all the data available


## Architecture [diagram](/diagram) 
- redesign everything from scratch, use code where necessary coupled with nocode solution (as of now) but better integrated and with duplicates detection, better redundancy, less technical debt, better documentation etc..
