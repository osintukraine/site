<h2>Why ?</h2>
<p>My name is Ben, supporting Ukraine from Belgium, I’m a DevOps in the making but also have a quite diverse experience with all things digital, open source collaboration tools, self-hosting and information monitoring, automation;</p>
<p>On the 24th of February, I dropped everything I was doing to support Ukraine with information amplification, sourcing of good information sources, dashboards, after an initial deep dive into Telegram from mobile and manual translations, I wanted to find a solution to<strong> ease the pain of following the invasion of Ukraine</strong>, my first idea was to use Google Translate to ease translation process and <a href="https://amplifyukraine.eu">provide the resulting output on the open web</a> without the need of a telegram account.&nbsp;<br>This quickly evolved to a state where I’m able to host the <a href="https://ruprop.ukrainewararchive.eu/">translation content along with the original context.</a></p>
<p>This first iteration evolved into the current set of <a href="https://osintukraine.com/">tools displayed on the front-page</a>, basically pushing the translations to different Discords, Telegram and Mastodon/Web channels with the intent to facilitate access, searching and archiving for<strong> different reasons</strong> :&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>To eliminate the language barrier issue</strong> as much as possible with the current state of machine translation, I still remember 2014 and how the invasion of Crimea &amp; Donbass left Ukraine voiceless.</li>
  <li>Provide <strong>a solution for </strong><a href="https://rss.osintukraine.com"><strong>newsrooms,</strong></a><strong> journalists, activists and basically everyone to have an easier access to this information</strong> for certainly, one of the defining moment of our generation in Europe and the global impact the War on Ukraine unleashed.</li>
  <li><strong>Hunt for Russian Disinformation</strong> narratives and war crimes with the intent to archive it outside big platforms</li>
  <li>Find <strong>intelligence signal in the ongoing cyberwar leaks</strong> and operations to disrupt Putin and the system he controls to wage war on Ukraine.</li>
  <li><strong>Pressure</strong> European capitals to <strong>not concede a pre-cooked defeat with Putin at the cost of Ukraine integrity</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Pressure Western Governments</strong> to actually deliver their <strong>Help to Ukraine</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Boycott Amnesty International</strong> until the organization retract the “report” and formally apologies to Ukraine.</li>
  <li><strong>Put the Media under pressure for not covering Ukraine</strong>, putting constantly the aggressor propaganda instead of the impact of the war against Ukraine.</li>
  <li><strong>Pressure Western Governments</strong> <strong>and allies</strong> to Officially designate <strong>Russia as a Terrorist State.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Weapons for Ukraine</strong> because a genocidal war from a Terrorist State does not get stopped by wishful thinking for peace.</li>
</ol>
